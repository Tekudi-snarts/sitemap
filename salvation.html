    </p>What is salvation to the Seventh day adventist (SDA) church:
    To the SDA church salvation is not something you can earn purely through your good works alone. As mentioned in the source of the SDA faith ‘The holy bible'. Isaiah 
    64:4(NIV) “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. This causes the Seventh day adventists to say that salvation is 
    in fact not earned but given as a gift from the lord. But what in essence is salvation. According to the adventist website “Salvation is being saved from our sins and 
    accepting God’s gift of eternal life. When you accept God’s salvation, you can be at peace about your future. You don’t have to live in fear because God has promised to save 
    you from the eternal consequences of sin.” (Seventh Day Adventist Church, n.d.). So in turn what we find is that salvation is a gift given by God that cannot be earned, we 
    find that salvation is the gift of eternal life instead of death as the consequences of sin is death, however it is not simply just a death where you are dead and you go to 
    the afterlife but an eternal sleep where you know nothing, feel nothing. Because death cannot be a gateway to a better life otherwise dying would have no meaning. Written in 
    what the SDA church believes to be the law of god in the “word of God” it says (Luke 16:17 “It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen 
    to drop out of the Law.”) This means that salvation should be impossible right? No human can die for one another as we cannot cleanse impurities with impurities the same way don't use dirty water as we are 
    born into sin and we cannot just not die according to the law. To counter this the son of the trio of ‘God’ came down unto earth to pay the 
    price, abiding by God’s law so that we can still have eternal life despite being sinners. This is the story of Jesus and his time on earth as human found throughout the 
    story of the new testament. This means that to the people of the seventh day adventist faith salvation is eternal life, salvation is mercy to the punishment we can choose to 
    avoid. You choose this eternal life by knowing the one who holds the salvation for us the human race to choose and if we decide that Jesus is not the one for us then he 
    finds no fault in that because to the SDA church he is a just God who grants free choice. <br>
  
    Why is salvation to the SDA Church important:<br>
    Salvation to the Adventist church is the end game. The SDA church has a set of “Fundamental Beliefs”. These 28 beliefs are essential to how those in the SDA faith interpret 
    the scripture or the holy bible that is the basis of their faith. Focussing on the most relevant ones we find that 8-11 are of interest when discussing salvation and its 
    importance. Number 8 is called the great controversy. This is known as the major battle between good and evil that happened an unknown amount of time ago. It's a battle 
    between God and his most perfect angel, Lucifer, who turns rebellious and starts the battle between good and evil and introduces sin into the picture thus causing a need for 
    salvation when he later tempts the first humans into joining him in sinning against God. Number 9 is the ratification of the great controversy and its sin problem being the 
    life, death and resurrection of the saviour and messiah Jesus christ. “In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God 
    provided the only means of atonement for human sin” (Seventh day Adventist Church, n.d.) This quote helps us to understand why Jesus came down to earth in the first place. 
    Number 10 of the fundamental beliefs is a result of the fundamental belief number 9 as it is the experience of salvation. It says “In infinite love and mercy God made 
   Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God.” (Seventh day Adventist Church, n.d.) Because of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the 
   son's sin was forgiven and salvation could be introduced into the human race so that anyone who has sinned (which is everyone) can be forgiven and saved from the eternal death that awaits after the second 
   coming for anyone who refuses Salvation. Number 11 follows after accepting fundamental belief #10. Mentioned beforehand is how when accepting salvation you also accept a relationship with christ and 
   fundamental belief #11 helps to cement that as its named “Growing in Christ” and it says “No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. 
   In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, 
   gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the Church.” (Seventh day Adventist Church, n.d.) These fundamentals are important because of the  story that they show. One of a fall 
   from grace into a pit of sin. To the beginning of the rescue arc to the cementing of what Jesus did when he came down to earth and how his short 33 year long visit is still providing aid and relief to 
   believers around the world to this day. These fundamentals also demonstrate how harsh this reality we live in is. Without salvation there is nothing more for humans, just a short time on the planet earth 
   before dying forever with nothing more for us, no afterlife, no resurrection and no incarnation. But because of salvation these fundamentals teach us that there is more and that God did all of this for us 
   and he's not going to rescue us and leave but give us his holy spirit so that we are guided and able to hope for something more.</p>

    </p>What is salvation to the islamic church:
    The source of belief for the islamic church is called the Quran. According to islam the human race forgot the Allah’s teachings and so to pay for their crimes against him the human race was sent 
    down to Earth but was promised guidance of Allah. “Yawm ad-Din is the Day of Judgement, when Allah will decide how people will spend their 
    afterlife.” (BBC, n.d.) After Allah’s purpose for the universe is fulfilled he will destroy the Earth and judge the people based on their intentions to their deeds or 
    actions. “They whose balances shall be heavy shall be blessed. But those whose balances shall be light, they shall lose their soul, abiding in hell forever (Surah 23:102- 
    104) (Qu’ran).” According to islam there is not much of a need for salvation as there is no sin to be freed from but more so a scale. A scale that weighs the good and bad 
    deeds of a person through their life. “Since Muslims do not recognize original sin, they see no need for salvation in the Christian sense. There is nothing to be saved from. 
    Consequently, if there was no original sin, there is no need for a Saviour. Salvation, in Islam, is based upon the deeds of a person. The Quran says,”(Blue Letter Bible, 
    n.d.). This means that in a very basic form salvation to islam is being spared from the wrath of Allah and not being left to torture in hell forever.<br>

    Why is salvation to Islam important:<br>
    Islam has five pillars that are essential to the make up of the religion. Those pillars are:
    Profession of faith (Shahada) <br>
    Prayer (Salat)<br>
    Alms (Zakat)<br>
    Fasting (Sawm)<br>
    Pilgrimage (Hajj)<br>
    These five pillars together form a base that all muslims can base their faith on and provide a shared faith and belief to all muslims around the world. Together they form objectives for every muslim to 
    fufill in their life. “Each of the five pillars work in tandem with one another to bring the essence of Islam as a religion of peace and submission to Allah SWT, into the lifestyle of every Muslim” ( 
    (Islamic Relief, n.d.) These five pillars are very important because they are the essence of the islamic faith and everything in it and every action that a muslim takes is based in these five pillars of 
    the islamic faith.<br>
    The pillar of the profession of faith (Shahada) is believing that “Monotheism and the belief in Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God is the central tenet of Islam around which 
    everything else revolves” (Islamic Relief, n.d.) In the same way that SDA believers form around that God is the only god there is mulims also believe that Allah is the only god and his messenger is the 
    prophet Mohammed (peace be unto him).<br>
    The second pillar relates to the first by reciting the Shahada and praying 5 times a day, every day. This helps Muslims to remember the integral first pillar. “Salah is the ritual prayer of Islam through 
    which all Muslims conform to the will of Allah. Prayer is performed in the direction of Mecca five times a day. Friday is set aside as the day for congregational prayer (Jum’a)” (Knott, 2016) As it states 
    on the fifth day congregational prayer is conducted and many muslims join together in a mosque to pray and conform to the will of Allah. The five prayers conducted every day are called Fajr prayer, Zuhr 
    prayer, Asr prayer, Maghrib prayer and the Isha prayer. It is believed that Allah passes these prayer times unto the prophet Mohammed (peace be unto him) who then in turn passed the knowledge to the 
    people. Each time of the prayer is not designated by exact time but by events that happen throughout the day such as sunsets, sunrises and etc
    The third pillar is the pillar of Almsgiving (Zakat). Almsgiving is the pillar that promotes acts of charity. Muslims donate surplus wealth for “The term zakat refers to the obligatory donation of a 
    portion of a Muslim’s surplus wealth. Islamic charities encourage donors to use their services to relieve suffering and to help refugees, victims of environmental disasters, the urban poor and those in 
    conflict zones and in recent years relief has been provided in Gaza, Syria, Yemen and Iraq” (Knott, 2016) They do this to ensure that wealth is evenly distributed so that people with less can have the 
    essentials for the needs.<br>
    The fasting pillar (Sawm) is represented by Ramadan known as the month of fasting. “the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. During daylight hours (which vary depending on the time of year in which Ramadan 
    falls), they abstain from food and drink, sexual activity and smoking, breaking the fast with a meal after sunset”. People refrain from all these physical activities to gain control over human needs. This 
    way can form a stronger connection to Allah
    Salvation is similar to the pilgrimage Pillar of Islam or Hajj. Hajj is a spiritual journey that one takes in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The result of completing the ritual everyone must do in their lifetime if 
    they can afford it is “And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (pilgrimage accepted by Allah) is nothing but Paradise.” (Human Appeal, 2020) One could say that when comparing it to the SDA church’s idea of salvation 
    that this is very similar as completing it means that you are allowed into paradise with Allah due to your diligence. If that isn't enough then look at this quote and see that although salvation is not 
    seen easily its idea and principals are present in other forms ``Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or transgression will return [free from sins] as he was on the day his mother gave 
    birth to him.” This means that Salvation is important to islam because after perfoming one of the pillars of the Islamic faith we find that it helps to lead that person to paradise.
