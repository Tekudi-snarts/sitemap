    </p>The difference:
The biggest difference that separates the religions when it concerns salvation is the baseline definition about it. For starters when talking about the SDA church it is believed the original sin that brought the fall of Adam and Eve and everyone to come from them (all humans) and thus cursing the human race with the price of death is the reason for salvation. However for the Islamic faith no such event occured and as such humans are born into the world as a blank canvas who are capable of good and evil. All of this is concerning the beginning but when we look at the “Endgame” for the human race we find two different but similar endings. To the SDA church we see that when the “Son of God” returns to Earth to take those who accept salvation with him into heaven forever and those who chose against it will remain on earth to be destroyed forever fulfilling the law of God by serving the punishment of sin being death. “Most Muslims believe they have free will to make their own choices. They also believe that they will be judged by God for those choices. They recognise that humans are still responsible for their actions.”  (BBC, n.d.)This means in short that Allah will take the actions a person has taken and be judged. If found that their negatives outweigh the positives then an eternal suffering in hell should await them but if found in favour then paradise is where they will be taken. Now when looking deeply at the base meaning of salvation we find that the common factor between the two faiths is forgiveness. However who it is granted to is a different story. See Seventh day Adventists believe that he who repents and commits their life to the lord will be forgiven and granted salvation as it says in the source of the Seventh day Adventist belief the holy bible “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9”. But in the islamic faith it says “Forgiveness is not something that is offered to everyone in Islam. Only those whom Allah is pleased to forgive can be forgiven.” (Blue Letter Bible) and from the source of faith the Quran itself “Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin (Surah 4:48).” This means that no one is guaranteed salvation and forgiveness but will only know on judgement day the consequences of their actions.  The next difference is the how. In christianity someone cannot earn salvation through good works “we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away” (Isaiah 64:6).” showing us how we do not get through heaven with good works as a person but through the good works of the lord dying on the cross for us. Now some may find a flaw in this logic, why ever worry about not sinning. After all if it is not your actions that grant passage what is it that will get you into heaven. This quote sums it up perfectly “We receive salvation in Christ through repentance and faith. This means turning away from sinful ways (repentance) and turning to God (faith), trusting in Christ. Jesus will forgive your sins and set you on a path to life with Him. We cannot earn this right, it is His free gift. "By grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast." Ephesians 2:8-9” . From the source of the faith it shows to us that we cannot do anything that would give us salvation because it's not going to unless that relationship with God is there. In short the main differences we find is that with the SDA church your works do not grant anything but it is by having a relationship with god that he will grant salvation to you and save you from an eternal death. In islam there is no real salvation and the qu’ran leads us to believe that </p>
